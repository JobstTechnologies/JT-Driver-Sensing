from version 0.94 to 0.95

  the settings for min/max show now as preset the current min/max values

  sometimes incorrect
- when the calibration concentration was changed in the dialog, it was not
  always taken into account


from version 0.93 to 0.94

bugfixes:
- when the chart contained more than 20.000 data points the program began
  to become slow
- when the chart is not in scrolling mode the data range was not updated in
  every case for the new data  


from version 0.92 to 0.93

improvement:
- rearrange the tab 'Pump Control' to make the main program window fit also to
  smaller high-DPI laptop screens
  
bugfix:
- assure that the buttons in the charts don't disappear when the main window
  size is changed


from version 0.91 to 0.92

improvements:
- zooming in the charts is now also possible by dragging up-right
