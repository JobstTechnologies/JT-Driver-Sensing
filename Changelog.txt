- fix wrong time format in toltips in the data graph


from version 0.997.1 to 0.998

improvements:
- it is now possible to automatically recalibrate after a pump step of choice
- new option to turn off the temperature correction
- more stable serial data readout mechanism


from version 0.997 to 0.997.1

bugfixes:
- fix buffer overflow for long SIX measurements
- fix enabling state of valve controls


from version 0.996 to 0.997

improvement:
- it is now possible to control up to 8 valves in a setup
  (by outputting 3.3 V to the valve controller)

bugfix:
- the pumps 5-8 in step 1 were by default disabled


from version 0.995.1 to 0.996

bugfixes:
- fix the Free Pumps functionality
- when the USB connection to the driver was lost, the software could be in a
  state where it could no longer readout the firmware version after reconnecting


from version 0.995 to 0.995.1

compilation:
- Win32 builds are now available
- since this release at least Lazarus 2.2 is necessary to compile


from version 0.994 to 0.995

improvements:
- it is now possible to change the time unit in the sensro data chart
  via the context menu (right-click into the chart)
- with a right-click on the Sensor Data File field it is possible
  to change it and this way trigger a new data acquisition run
- always display current channel value, independent if channel is shown in chart

bugfixes:
- fix crash on unloading a .def file for IV4 sensors
- fix a minor UI issue in the pump control tab
- hide the Windows-specific context menu for some UI fields


from version 0.993 to 0.994

improvements:
- when changing the unit of the displayed diagram values to nA or mmol/l
  all diagram values will be recalculated to this unit
  (the CSV output file will not be recalculated since it
   already contains the values in both units)

bugfixes:
- fix bug on calculating sensor value from readout data
- correct info in some error messages


from version 0.992 to 0.993

improvements:
- display the SIX ID number below the connected port
- it is now possible to set a time down to 0.05 s per pump action step

bugfixes:
- when entering Live mode assure that the other action steps are ignored
- don't allow to enter more than 100% duty cycle


from version 0.99 to 0.992

bugfixes:
- fix wrong channel assignment when changing channel appearance
- propose valid filenames for all file types when saving


from version 0.98 to 0.99

bugfixes:
- re-enable all settings after an action file was loaded and run
- when running multiple steps, show the currently executed step correctly

improvements:
- when more than one step is used, the currently executed step is
  highlighted by an asterisk in its name
- it is now possible to view the state of pumps 5 - 8 while the pumps
  are running
- the program stores now the chart settings when it is closed
  To get the default appearance, use the new menu
  Miscellaneous -> Reset Chart Appearance


from version 0.97 to 0.98

bugfixes:
- action files created with versions of JT Pump Driver that only support 4 pumps
  can now be loaded and executed without errors
- the settings for pump 5 - 8 are now disabled when their step is not used
- no action file can be loaded or saved while the pumps are running


from version 0.96 to 0.97

bugfix:
- fix that endless repeats of multiple pumping steps could lead to a crash


from version 0.95 to 0.96

improvement:
- a started calibration can now be aborted by right-clicking on the chart

bugfixes:
- fix the calibration on a channel containing the mean of two other channels
- axis settings dialog fixes
- definition file handling fixes


from version 0.94 to 0.95

improvements:
- to change the background color of a chart, right-click on the chart
  The advantage is that now every left double-click on a chart axis will
  open the axis settings dialog and not sometimes the color dialog.
- when changing the chart axis properties (by double-clicking on an axis)
  the settings for min/max show now as preset the current min/max values 

bugfixes:
- when temperature was displayed in the SIX chart its axis range was
  sometimes incorrect
- when the calibration concentration was changed in the dialog, it was not
  always taken into account


from version 0.93 to 0.94

bugfixes:
- when the chart contained more than 20.000 data points the program began
  to become slow
- when the chart is not in scrolling mode the data range was not updated in
  every case for the new data  


from version 0.92 to 0.93

improvement:
- rearrange the tab 'Pump Control' to make the main program window fit also to
  smaller high-DPI laptop screens
  
bugfix:
- assure that the buttons in the charts don't disappear when the main window
  size is changed


from version 0.91 to 0.92

improvements:
- zooming in the charts is now also possible by dragging up-right
- the zooming rectangle border is now properly shown
- stop the chart data scrolling while calibrating
- stop the chart data scrolling only when zoomed in, not when zoomed out
